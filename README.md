This was an examination task on a previous job interview.

The problem:

Your task is to go through an N * M matrix spirally from the top-left corner clockwise direction.

Example:

    [
     [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
     [ 5, 6, 7, 8 ],
     [ 9, 10, 11, 12 ]
    ]

The result of the matrix above is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 11, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7
